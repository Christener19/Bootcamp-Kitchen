# Bootcamp Kitchen


## Overview
Welcome to Bootcamp Kitchen, your solution for finding 15 minutes recipes tailored to your preferences, whether it be specific ingredients or dietary requirements.
The application provides a variety of meals, such as gluten-free or vegan recipies. 

## The Brief

My team were given a brief to solve a problem that bootcampers face when learning on a intense 16 week course. A common theme amongst the group was the time it takes to prepare and cook a nuturious meal. We decidied to make an application that would provide 15 minutes recipies to give bootcampers both more time, and also make sure that they would have a nutritious meal. 

 ## Problem Statement:

"The intense nature of this course meant that some bootcampers are struggling to maintain nutritional self-care."

What could help us solve this problem? Bootcamp Kitchen

## Research:
In order to create an app that truly meets the needs of users we conducted thorough research of our competitors, created a questionnaire and obtained valuable information. The most valuable and comprehensive data was collected during our user interviews with fellow bootcampers. Through these interviews, we learned that their eating habits had changed since starting the bootcamp. And so, that was it - bootcampers wanted quick recipies to use to have nuturious meals.
